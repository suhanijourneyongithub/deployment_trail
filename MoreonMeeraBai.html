            <p>
                <span style = "color : rgb(210, 40, 40); font-size: 18;">Meera Bai's Childhood: </span>
                The image of Krishna was so deeply ingrained in Mirabai's childhood that from her adolescence till her death, 
                she considered Krishna as her everything. Mirabai, the only daughter of Rathore Ratan Singh ji of Jodhpur, 
                was born in the sixteenth century.
                <br>
                Since childhood, she was engrossed in devotion to Krishna. 
                Due to an incident that happened in Mirabai's childhood, her love for Krishna reached its peak. 
                One day a marriage procession came to the house of some big man in his neighbourhood. 
                All the women were standing on the terrace watching the procession. Meera also started watching the wedding procession. 
                Seeing the wedding procession, Meera asked her mother, who is my groom? 
                On this his mother pointed towards the idol of Krishna and said that this is your groom. 
                Just this thing got tied like a knot in Meera's mind. 
                <br>
                <span style = "color : rgb(210, 40, 40); font-size: 18;">Married Life and Bhakti: </span>
                Later Mirabai was married to Bhojraj, son of Maharana Sanga.
                <br>
                Meera has said about the Guru that there is no devotion without accepting the Guru. 
                Only a devout person can tell the secret of attaining God. He is the true Guru. 
                Mira's own verse suggests that his guru was Raidas. 
                <br>
                At first Mirabai refused for this marriage, but when insisted, she started crying bitterly. 
                At the time of farewell after the marriage, she took with her the same idol of Krishna, 
                whom her mother had described as her groom. 
                <br>
                After completing her household chores at her in-laws' house, 
                Meera would go to Krishna's temple every day and worship Krishna, singing and dancing in front of his idol. 
                His in-laws considered Tulja Bhavani i.e. Durga as the family goddess. When Meera refused to worship the family goddess, 
                her family did not approve of her devotion. 
                <br>
                <span style = "color : rgb(210, 40, 40); font-size: 18;">Udabai's Conspiracy: </span>
                Mirabai's sister-in-law Udabai hatched a conspiracy against her to defame her. 
                He tells Rana that Meera has a secret love with someone and that he has seen Meera talking to her lover in the temple. 
                Rana Kumbha went to the temple with his sister at midnight. 
                He broke the door of the temple and reached inside and saw that Meera was sitting alone in front of the idol of Krishna in a state of ecstasy, 
                talking to the idol and singing merrily. Rana shouted at Meera - 'Meera, bring the lover you are talking to right now in front of me.'
                Meera replied – ‘He is sitting in front – my master – the thief, who has stolen my heart,’ and she went into samadhi.
                Rana Kumbha was heartbroken by this incident, but still he played the role of a good husband and supported Meera till his death. 
                <br>
                Although Meera had no desire for the throne, Rana's relatives started harassing Meera in many ways.
                <br>
                <span style = "color : rgb(210, 40, 40); font-size: 18;">Bhakt Meera: </span>
                Meera's love for Krishna was very private in the beginning, but later sometimes Meera's mind became 
                so filled with love that she started dancing and singing in front of common people and in religious festivals. 
                She used to quietly leave the Chittor fort at night and participate in the satsang going on in the city. 
                <br>
                <span style = "color : rgb(210, 40, 40); font-size: 18;">Vikramaditya's plan against Meerabai: </span>
                Meera's brother-in-law Vikramaditya, who became the new king of Chittorgarh, was very strict. 
                He strongly opposed Meera's devotion, her mixing with common people and her carelessness towards women's modesty.
                He tried many times to kill Meera. Marriage means that you surrender everything you have, your body,
                your mind and your emotions, for one person. 
                <br>
                Even once he sent a poisonous snake to Meera in a basket of flowers and sent a 
                message to Meera that there were flower necklaces in the basket. After getting up carefully, 
                when Meera opened the basket, a beautiful idol of Krishna with a garland of flowers came out of it.
                The bed of thorns prepared by Rana also became a bed of flowers for Meera when she went to sleep on it.
                <br>
                <span style = "color : rgb(210, 40, 40); font-size: 18;">Meerabai's final journey: </span>
                When the torture became unbearable, she left Chittor. She first went to Merta, but when she did not find satisfaction there too, 
                after some time she turned to Vrindavan, the center of Krishna devotion. Meera believed that she was Gopi Madhvi, who had taken birth again.
                Madhvi was madly in love with Krishna. Well, Meera continued her pilgrimage, traveling across North India, 
                dancing and singing from one village to another. 
                <br>
                It is believed that she spent the last few years of his life in Dwarka, 
                Gujarat. It is said that Meera merged into the idol of Dwarkadhish in the Temple, in front of the entire crowd of spectators.
